# Zuma-Deluxe-HD-24

## Fork Info
This should compile on any reasonable platform. (OK, probably not windows, but if that's the case- please, report a bug.)
Anyhoo, you'll probably still need to change the `CMakeLists.txt` file to search in the proper paths for your system.
With the transfer to `SDL_mixer`, some things have been lost. Namely, the fact that `SDL_mixer` can only play the first
track of the "OST", so that's the music for the whole game. (Looking into this.) Secondly, `SDL_mixer` doesn't support pitch
shifting natively, so until I stop being lazy, we don't have pitch shifting either.

A remake of the legendary 2003 PopCap game with improved textures and support for 16:9 aspect ratio. Made by me and [s4lat](https://github.com/s4lat).
